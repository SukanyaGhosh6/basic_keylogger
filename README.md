# basic_keylogger
Built this basic keylogger while exploring how keyboard event capturing actually works behind the scenes. It's a super simple Python script that records every key press into a local file â€” nothing fancy, just me getting curious and learning one mini project at a time. Strictly for educational and ethical purposes!
